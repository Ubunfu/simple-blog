            Pretty curious how this is going to go.  It seems a little bit like overkill now,
            because it probably is, but I think it would be good to get used to using such a thing
            if it's a pretty standard practice among people who build things mostly by hand.  And
            I can't deny that it seems pretty powerful.

              <p>The above is a figure tag.  Herrr is a link to the spec: <br> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure">HTML5 Figure</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                We can use this for images, SVGs, code snippets, charts, or other visual things.  They usually have captions on them for clarity.

              <p>This is the main content of the blog post! It is an article tag.  Herrr's the link:
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">HTML5 Article</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a really interesting tag. Apparently, its symantic meaning is: "a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry."
              </p>
              <p>
                    Sounds perfect, right?...
              </p>
              <p>In the upper right is a time element.  Herr is that link too: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time">HTML5 Time</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                This time element allows the browser to understand that the value inside of the "datetime" parameter is the true date and time associated with this article. I'm still not quite sure what the use of that is.It also seems pretty manual.. maybe there is a way to use it dynamically or something.
              </p>
              <p>The "pubdate" parameter is a boolean that tells the browser even further that this is the date at which the article was actually published.  Not sure what I can do with that yet.
